abstract = {The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution offers significant opportunities to capitalise on the growth of digitalisation and has the potential to enable the ‘system of systems’ approach required in increasingly complex infrastructure systems. This paper reviews the extent to which research in economic infrastructure sectors has engaged with fields of AI, to investigate the specific AI methods chosen and the purposes to which they have been applied both within and across sectors. Machine learning is found to dominate the research in this field, with methods such as artificial neural networks, support vector machines, and random forests among the most popular. The automated reasoning technique of fuzzy logic has also seen widespread use, due to its ability to incorporate uncertainties in input variables. Across the infrastructure sectors of energy, water and wastewater, transport, and telecommunications, the main purposes to which AI has been applied are network provision, forecasting, routing, maintenance and security, and network quality management. The data-driven nature of AI offers significant flexibility, and work has been conducted across a range of network sizes and at different temporal and geographic scales. However, there remains a lack of integration of planning and policy concerns, such as stakeholder engagement and quantitative feasibility assessment, and the majority of research focuses on a specific type of infrastructure, with an absence of work beyond individual economic sectors. To enable solutions to be implemented into real-world infrastructure systems, research will need to move away from a siloed perspective and adopt a more interdisciplinary perspective that considers the increasing interconnectedness of these systems.}

abstract = {The last decades have been characterized by unprecedented technological advances, many of them powered by modern technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). The world has become more digitally connected than ever, but we face major challenges. One of the most significant is cybercrime, which has emerged as a global threat to governments, businesses, and civil societies. The pervasiveness of digital technologies combined with a constantly shifting technological foundation has created a complex and powerful playground for cybercriminals, which triggered a surge in demand for intelligent threat detection systems based on machine and deep learning. This paper investigates AI-based cyber threat detection to protect our modern digital ecosystems. The primary focus is on evaluating ML-based classifiers and ensembles for anomaly-based malware detection and network intrusion detection and how to integrate those models in the context of network security, mobile security, and IoT security. The discussion highlights the challenges when deploying and integrating AI-enabled cybersecurity solutions into existing enterprise systems and IT infrastructures, including options to overcome those challenges. Finally, the paper provides future research directions to further increase the security and resilience of our modern digital industries, infrastructures, and ecosystems.}

abstract = {Industry 4.0 transforms the manufacturing sector with dynamic, networked, complex industrial environments. These environments generate vast amounts of data and require technology and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to achieve intelligent, efficient, and sustainable production processes. This paper comprehensively reviews 45 articles on AI and Industry 4.0 integration. We propose a taxonomy for AI in Industry 4.0 and classify approaches into Industry 4.0 design and product quality control methods. Our analysis shows that 58 percent of papers use product quality control methods. Besides, this paper identifies challenges and open issues by illuminating the current landscape. The findings showed that machine learning is the most common AI method for improving Industry 4.0 with 41 percent, and Python is the most used tool for simulation.}

abstract = {Currently Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) support most of the industrial manufacturing processes. The IT revolution has brought an important transformation in organizations with high impacts, which are comparable to the mechanization and electricity brought in the first and second industrial revolution. This evolvement has promoted the emergence of cloud-based systems, the Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data, Industry 4.0, BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) and CYOD (Choose Your Own Device) trends. However, new technological solutions always carry security vulnerabilities, which most of time reveal unexpected risks. In fact, with increasing reliance on technology to gain competitive advantage, security issues have been one of the most critical and challenging requirements for conducting successful business. In this paper, it is highlighted some reflections regarding the challenges of Industry 4.0 emphasizing the security issues, towards raising awareness for security good practices within Industry 4.0.}

abstract = {The research presented in this paper looks at evaluating RAMI4.0, a Research Architecture (RA) designed for Industry 4.0, through the representation of an existing Cyber-Physical System’s (CPSs) key functionality. The use case represented is that of a UK firm refurbishing End of Life (EoL) IT devices for business clients. EoL refurbishment is a domain with many complexities due to an inherent business model which results in varying quantities, types and conditions of received devices. These uncertainties can generally not be addressed until the devices have arrived in the facility and are inspected. RAs are an important tool used in system development to represent functionality, this representation should be high level and allow the easy communication of key concepts for not only client-to-developers and developer-to-developer but also either to an audience. An appropriate RA will help industrialists to understand what Industry 4.0 means to them (i.e. increased flexibility and control) and the functionality of any system potentially being invested in. The results of this research included two proposals for the extension of RAMI4.0 regarding the representation of security and humans within the systems. While Industry 4.0 focusses on CPSs this work also makes a further recommendation that the focus of modelling should be shifted to Cyber-Physical Human Systems (CPHSs) to ensure correct consideration of the humans within the system.}

abstract = {The use of engineering to drive down costs and improve productivity has been an ongoing business exercise since the first Industrial Revolution. The term Cyber-Physical System is a wide range of different computing technologies embedded with the next-generation engineered systems into the physical world. Connected Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) improve the lives of people and increase industry and manufacturing efficiency. It is affecting many branches of life such as transportation, healthcare and medicine, the environment, and energy. Industry 4.0 integrates humans, machines, and data to provide a holistic and interlinked approach to manufacturing, hence, increasing privacy concerns. For example, Autonomous Vehicles (AV) can be driven without a pilot and those systems can be hacked if there is a breach in the system. Nowadays, most of the systems are interconnected to the internet and nothing can be considered fully safe. Therefore, with this increase of security threats and privacy concerns, there is a need to assess and evaluate the trade-off between enhancements and improvements in manufacturing and the possible threats and security risks in the context of Cyber-Physical Systems. We need to bridge the gaps and overcome some of these limitations. In this work, we studied the security concerns emerging from interconnected Cyber-Physical systems, devices, and services in Industry 4.0. To identify security vulnerabilities, we have chosen the energy dataset because energy is the key point of every Cyber-Physical system so aimed to show the importance of energy, and the K-Means algorithm implemented which is an advanced Machine Learning and potential risks detected.}
